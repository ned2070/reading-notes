### DYBAMIC WEB PAGES WITH JAVASCRIPT

# What is Javascript?

Javascipt is a programming language which:

+ Is the *scripting* language which runs in a web browser (*client side* or *front end*) to make web pages dynamic and interactive.
+ Can also be ran on a wen server to process data (*server side* or *back end*).
+ Should not be confused with *Java*, they are not the same thing!

Javascript is an *interpreted* language, it is translated to the*machine language* used by the computer's *central processing unit* 
line by line as the program is running.

Javascript can be written in a plain text file with the extension **.js**  

A .js file can be linked to a web page via a <link> tag in the HTML.  

It's possible to include Javascript within the HTML but is not usually good practice. 
A seperate .js page keeps programming separate from the contents and structure and makes maintaining the website easier.
