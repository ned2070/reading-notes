### DYBAMIC WEB PAGES WITH JAVASCRIPT

# What is Javascript?

Javascipt is a programming language which:

+ Is the *scripting* language which runs in a web browser (*client side* or *front end*) to make web pages dynamic and interactive.
+ Can also be ran on a wen server to process data (*server side* or *back end*).
+ Should not be confused with *Java*, they are not the same thing!

Javascript is an *interpreted* language, it is translated to the*machine language* used by the computer's *central processing unit* 
line by line as the program is running.

Javascript can be written in a plain text file with the extension **.js**  

A .js file can be linked to a web page via a <link> tag in the HTML.  

It's possible to include Javascript within the HTML but is not usually good practice. 
A seperate .js page keeps programming separate from the contents and structure and makes maintaining the website easier.

### Javascipt Variables

A **variable** is a *container* for a piece of information.  

The **variable name** is the *label* on the container.

**Declaring** a variable is the act of creating and naming it.

Variables come in a variety of *types* depending on the type of information they hold.
Variable types are defined in the programming language.

An **Assignment** operator assigns a value to a variable. 
The assigned value becomes the information contained by the variable.

The assignment operator in Javascript is **=**.

Note that the mathematical equals sign in Javascript is ==.

There is also a *strictly equals* sign, ===. Strict equality means that both the value and the variable typeare the same.

Information *received* from the user is called **input**.

A common use of variables is to store and manipulate *input* and *output*.

Conversely, information *sent* to the user is **output**.

Input, information storage, information processing and output are the four basic functions carried out by all computers.
