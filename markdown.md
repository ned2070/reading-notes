# MARKDOWN

### What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a *markup* language.

This means that it is a system of annotations in a plain text document which creates formatting for the document when it's read by a program capable of interpreting those annotations.

The best known markup language is the HyperText Markup Language used to construct web pages.

Markdown is simpler than HTML. It's less powerful but also less obtrusive. Markdown is intended to be easily legible in a plain text reader.

### Why Use Markdown?

+ Markdown is **human readable**. If every application that reads Mardown stopped working the plain text files would still be intelligible and usable.
+ Markdown is **versatile**. It can be used to quickly create websites, documentation, notes or any kind of text document.
+ Markdown is **portable**. IMarkdown files can be opened by any type of text processor, on any operating system and on many websites.

### An Example of Markdown

Markdown uses the \# symbol to indicate a heading and the number of then to indicate the size of the heading from 1 to 6.

\# Heading Level 1 in the plain text file becomes

# Heading Level 1 

in the output of the Markup interpreter.

Similarly,

\#\#\#\#\#\# Heading Level 6 becomes

###### Heading Level 6
